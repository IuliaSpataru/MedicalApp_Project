Application Description: SynCCare

In most public hospitals, you cannot simply call the reception desk to inquire about the status of an admitted patient. This became especially evident during the pandemic,
when visits were restricted, leaving family members without a way to find out what was happening, if the hospitalized individual couldn’t communicate via phone.

The application is structured into two main parts:
User Interface (Website) – An easy-to-use platform designed for patients' relatives, allowing them to access essential health information about their loved ones with an intuitive design and user-friendly functionalities.
Internal Management Interface – An administrative system dedicated to medical staff, enabling real-time updates of patient records, facilitating efficient and coordinated management of treatments and daily activities within a secure environment.

The SynCCare application provides significant benefits for both patients' families and medical staff.
For relatives, it ensures complete transparency regarding the patient's condition, allowing them to track daily progress, request consultations, and receive real-time updates. 
At the same time, medical staff benefits from an efficient task management system, with precise permissions based on roles, enhancing coordination and effectiveness in patient care.
Additionally, the application guarantees information security by ensuring that only relevant individuals have access to sensitive patient data, maintaining confidentiality and protection.
Thus, the application facilitates clear and continuous communication between hospitals and families, reducing stress and offering better control over the medical care process.
